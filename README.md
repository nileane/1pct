# Source for Nileane.fr
## Powered by GitHub Pages and Jekyll

To build, make sure you have Bundler installed:
```
gem install bundler
```

Install needed dependencies:
```
cd nileane.fr/
bundle install
```

You can now build my website, and directly run it on a local server at localhost:4000 (unless configured otherwise).
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
